              <h2>Jonathan Tate</h2>
              <h5>Director of Customer Support at Fair.com</h5>
              <p>
                I had the privilege of managing Farid at Acorns while he was an Investor Success Representative. Farid has a humble attitude and team first approach which made it easy to maintain open dialogue for feedback and brainstorming. He quickly became one of my goto players, often using his computer savvy to finding more efficient ways to resolve issues. 
                Farid would often stay late to study and improve his coding, often taking additional work home. His drive is second to none and his approachable and teachable attitude make him an asset for any team.

              <p>
                Farid is the type of person who knows how to get the job done. He does his research thoroughly and will not stop until his project is finished. His tenacity is inspiring. Farid is extremely detail-oriented, keeping his eye out for any mistakes or sloppiness. This is key to any company because most people do not have the eye for perfection like Farid does. He also has the motivation and desire to learn, which is essential for success in any project he undertakes. I would recommend Farid as a positive asset for any type of company because they would invest upon an employee who is diligent, optimistic and tenacious.

                Working with Farid on data driven projects was a pleasure -- he has a great attitude, is extremely talented with excel and possesses strong creative problem solving ability. He is good candidate for an analytical type of position dealing with large amounts of data.
